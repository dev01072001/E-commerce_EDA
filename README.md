Business Takeaways (from EDA)

Standard Class is the most frequently chosen shipping mode across all orders.

The Consumer segment dominates in order volume, followed by Corporate and Home Office.

The average shipping duration is around 4 days — potential room for delivery speed optimization.

Phones are the highest-selling sub-category by volume.

Furniture shows good sales figures but contributes very little to profit — a red flag for product strategy.

Office Supplies have the highest profit margins — opportunity to scale this category.

The West region leads in overall sales.

California and New York are top-performing states in both sales and profit.

Texas and Ohio are consistent loss-making regions — need strategic attention or cost control.

Sales have been increasing year-on-year, with strong growth in the last quarter. However, recent months show saturated profits despite high sales.

Discounts are negatively impacting profitability in most categories — rethink discounting policies.
